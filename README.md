## Core User Stories
- Add tasks to a list so I can keep track of them
- Check things off my list so I can see what I have done 
- Check things from the list if I don't need to do them anymore
- Use all of the features without a mouse

## Stretch User Stories
- Filter out completed to-dos so I can focus on what is left to do
- Add local storage for reload 
- Use templates and fragments to make list

## Other Issues
- Having the foggiest idea of how to test anyting :panda_face:
- Navigating the DOM tree
- Knowing what are Node lists and HTML Collections
