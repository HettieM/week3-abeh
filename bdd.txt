As todo list user,
I want to add items to my list,
so view I can them.

Scenario 1: User adds a new todo item.
Given that a user types input 
and submits,
then new todo item is displayed on a page
and input area cleared and on focus.


As todo list user, 
I want to check things off my list, 
then see them crossed out/grayed out


Scenario 2: User clicks on a todo li element
When the user clicks on the element 
then that item changes appearance to crossed out/grayed out


As todo list user
I want to delete items from my list
and see them removed from the display

Scenerio 3: User clicks delete button
When a user clicks the delete button
then the clicked li dissapears from the page

Check that you have a value. 
If I input an item and submit it. I want it to display on the list.
If I input 3 items and submit them. I want it to display on the list in the order I submitted them (newest to oldest).

Static testing

Unit testing
Check length of array for ul. For example if you add a item the list.length should be 1.
Check what happens if input field is empty 
Check what happens with different input types (?!*)
